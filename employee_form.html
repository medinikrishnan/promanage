    <title>Database Schema: Users Table</title>

    <!-- Milestone: Define user schema -->
    <h1>User Schema Definition</h1>
    <p>The user schema for our database has been fully defined. This schema is used to manage user information in our system and follows best practices for relational database design.</p>
    <h2>Table: Users</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>user_id</strong>: Primary Key, INT, auto-incremented, not null</li>
      <li><strong>username</strong>: VARCHAR(255), unique, not null</li>
      <li><strong>email</strong>: VARCHAR(255), unique, not null</li>
      <li><strong>password</strong>: VARCHAR(255), not null</li>
      <li><strong>createdAt</strong>: DATETIME, defaults to current_timestamp</li>
      <li><strong>updatedAt</strong>: DATETIME, defaults to current_timestamp, automatically updates on record change</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This schema has been implemented in our models and reflects all required attributes for the user domain.</p>
    <h1>Create Relationship Between Tables</h1>
    <p>
      All necessary relationships between the tables in the database have been established.
      The system uses proper foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity between the tables.
      For example, the <strong>Users</strong> table is linked to the <strong>Orders</strong> table via the user_id,
      and other tables such as <strong>Profiles</strong> and <strong>Payments</strong> are similarly connected.
    </p>
    <h2>Defined Relationships:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Users & Orders:</strong> The <code>user_id</code> in the Users table is referenced by the <code>customer_id</code> in the Orders table.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Users & Profiles:</strong> The <code>user_id</code> in the Users table is used as the primary key and is referenced in the Profiles table to uniquely map each user.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Orders & Payments:</strong> The Orders tableâ€™s <code>order_id</code> serves as a reference in the Payments table to relate each payment with the corresponding order.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These relationships have been implemented using foreign key constraints in the database schema,
      ensuring that the data remains consistent and that the tables are properly connected.
